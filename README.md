Urban Event-Crime Correlation Project  
Overview  
In the heart of downtown Toronto, a bustling hub of activity, major events draw large crowds and create dynamic environments. However, these gatherings are often accompanied by increased crime rates, posing a challenge to public safety. Our project aims to address this   issue by analyzing the correlation between major events and crime rates, using data science to predict and mitigate potential risks.  

Problem Statement  
The direct effects of event-related crime impact attendees, ranging from 5,000 to 55,000 people per event. Our goal is to enhance the safety and experience of these attendees while aiding police and security departments in optimizing resource allocation and minimizing  
 event-related crimes.  

Data Science Solution  
Leveraging data from the Toronto Police Department's major crime reports, we analyze crimes related to events since 2014. My approach includes:  

Identifying crime trends associated with major events.  
Standardizing crime data per 100 people to measure the impact more accurately.  
Utilizing predictive modelling to forecast required security measures for future events.  
Impact of the Solution  
By effectively predicting and preparing for potential crime at these events, we aim to reduce incidents such as DUIs, assaults, and other public safety hazards. This project has the potential to save lives and significantly decrease the damages caused by crimes.  

Dataset Description  
The major crime report dataset, released by the Toronto Police Department, contains over 360,000 rows with detailed information on crime occurrences. Additional data on concerts and sports events have been collected from Concert Archives and Wikipedia, totalling around  
 2,000 rows. This dataset includes dates, venues, estimated attendance, and event genres.  

Data Dictionary
